This content is for the course 02460 Advanced Machine Learning at Danish Technical University, Lyngby for the year of 2024.

Firstly, install the requirements into your virtual environment, e.g. using Anaconda:

```bash
conda create env --name <your-venv-name> # python = X.YZ, if you want to specify python versions.
conda activate <your-venv-name> # You should see (<your-venv-name>) in the left side of the terminal.
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All weeks contain the original, unaltered code handed out alongside the proposed solutions from the exercises, some not completely done.

### TODO:
- [ ] Add the theoretical exercise solutions.
- [ ] More descriptive names included.
- [ ] Annotate code with inputs to run correctly, and to clarify where I have written code for the exercises.
